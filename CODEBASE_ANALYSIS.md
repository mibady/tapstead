## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure
Tapstead follows a modern **Next.js App Router** architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
tapstead/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                    # Next.js 15 App Router pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/            # React components (UI, business logic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                   # Business logic, utilities, database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/                # Global CSS and Tailwind config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/               # Database schema and migrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ emails/                # Email templates (React Email)
```

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Server Components** for data fetching and SEO
- **Server Actions** for form handling and mutations
- **Client Components** for interactive features
- **Middleware** for authentication, security, and rate limiting
- **Row Level Security** for database access control

### Data Flow
1. **Public Pages** ‚Üí Server Components ‚Üí Static/Dynamic rendering
2. **Authenticated Pages** ‚Üí Middleware ‚Üí Auth Context ‚Üí Protected Components
3. **Forms** ‚Üí Server Actions ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Email Notifications
4. **Admin Functions** ‚Üí Role-based access ‚Üí Admin Dashboard

---

## Authentication System

### Provider: Supabase Auth
- **Session Management**: Real-time auth state with cookies
- **User Profiles**: Extended user data in custom `profiles` table
- **Role-Based Access**: Customer, Provider, Admin roles
- **Security Features**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, secure headers

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Auth Context provides:
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null
  userData: UserData | null
  loading: boolean
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  signUp: (email: string, password: string, metadata: any) => Promise<void>
  signOut: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### Protected Routes
- `/dashboard/*` - Any authenticated user
- `/admin/*` - Admin role required
- `/provider/*` - Provider role required
- Middleware enforces authentication and authorization

### Security Implementation
- **Comprehensive middleware** with rate limiting (60 req/min)
- **CSRF protection** with token validation
- **Security headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Row Level Security** policies for all database tables

---

## Payment Integration

### Current Status: **PROTOTYPE/DEMO**
The payment system has complete UI components but **no actual payment processing**.

### What's Implemented
- **Payment Forms**: Complete credit card collection UI
- **Subscription Plans**: 3-tier subscription system with discounts
- **Pricing Calculator**: Dynamic pricing with tax and discounts
- **Order Management**: Booking confirmation and order summaries

### What's Missing
- **Payment Processor Integration**: No Stripe, PayPal, or other gateways
- **Recurring Billing**: No automated subscription payments
- **Transaction Records**: No payment history or invoicing
- **Refund System**: No refund processing capabilities

### Subscription Plans
1. **Pay-As-You-Go**: Free with standard pricing
2. **Home Care Plus**: $49/month (15% discount)
3. **Premium Care**: $99/month (25% discount)

### Critical Gap
**All payment processing is simulated** - requires immediate integration with payment processor for production use.

## Database Schema

### Core Tables Structure

```sql
-- User Management
users (auth.users extension)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profiles (user metadata)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subscriptions (billing plans)

-- Service Management  
services (catalog of available services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bookings (customer orders)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tracking (real-time status)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reviews (customer feedback)

- **Providers** belong to **users** and can have multiple **bookings**
- **Bookings** track **services**, **providers**, and **payments**
- **Applications** flow to **provider** accounts upon approval

## Security Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Authorization Bypass in Admin Functions**
   - Risk: Critical
   - Impact: Unauthorized access to all booking and provider data
   - Location: `/app/admin/page.tsx` - Direct database queries without server-side auth

2. **Missing Authorization in Booking Actions**
   - Risk: Critical  
   - Impact: Any user can modify any booking
   - Location: `/lib/actions/booking-actions.ts` - No ownership verification

3. **XSS Vulnerability in Blog Content**
   - Risk: High
   - Impact: Stored XSS through blog posts
   - Location: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage without sanitization

4. **Service Role Key Exposure Risk**
   - Risk: High
   - Impact: Full database access if compromised
   - Location: Server-side Supabase client with broad permissions

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

5. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - Missing comprehensive validation on form inputs
   - Potential injection attacks and data corruption

6. **Information Disclosure in Error Messages**
   - Detailed error logging may expose sensitive information
   - Need structured logging with severity levels

7. **Weak Content Security Policy**
   - CSP allows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`
   - Need strict CSP with nonce-based approach

### ‚úÖ Security Strengths
- Strong authentication framework with Supabase
- Comprehensive Row Level Security policies

   typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }
   ```
   **Impact**: Type errors and linting issues bypass production builds

2. **Type Safety Violations**
   - Excessive `any` usage in booking components
   - Missing proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Type assertions without validation

3. **Large Component Files**
   - `sidebar.tsx`: 763 lines (needs refactoring)
   - `pro-application-form.tsx`: 611 lines
   - Multiple components over 400 lines

### üü° Moderate Issues

4. **File Organization**
