# Deployment Notes

## Build Process
- Use `pnpm build` or `node build.js` to build the project
- The custom `build.js` script helps resolve Windows-specific build issues

## Vercel Deployment
- Ensure Git commits use the email address registered with your GitHub account
- This ensures proper attribution and passing of Vercel deployment checks
