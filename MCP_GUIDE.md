# Advanced MCP 
  Stack Management & Best Practices

  ## Your Current MCP Stack Analysis

  You have **12 MCP servers** configured - this is an 
  enterprise-level setup! Here's how to organize and use 
  them effectively:

  ### **Database Layer (4 servers)**
  - RepMax Supabase MCP
  - Dental Hub Supabase
  - Tapstead Supabase
  - Supabase-mcp-server (likely your main one)

  ### **Web Scraping & Automation (3 servers)**
  - Puppeteer
  - Bright Data
  - Apify MCP

  ### **Infrastructure & DevOps (2 servers)**
  - Docker-MCP-Server
  - MCP_DOCKER

  ### **AI Enhancement (3 servers)**
  - Context7 (Upstash)
  - Knowledge Graph Memory
  - Task Master AI

  ### **Specialized Data (1 server)**
  - College Football Data

  ## Core Principles for Managing This Many MCPs

  ### 1. **Project-Specific MCP Selection**
  With 12 MCPs, you need to be strategic about which ones      
  to use for each project:

  **For RepMax project:**
  - Primary: RepMax Supabase MCP, Docker MCP, Puppeteer        
  - Supporting: Context7, Task Master AI

  **For Dental Hub project:**
  - Primary: Dental Hub Supabase, Puppeteer, Bright Data       
  - Supporting: Knowledge Graph Memory

  **For Tapstead project:**
  - Primary: Tapstead Supabase, Apify MCP, Puppeteer

  ### 2. **Hierarchical MCP Usage**
  Don't try to use all MCPs in one prompt. Create a
  hierarchy:

  **Level 1: Core Operations**
  - Start with your project-specific Supabase MCP
  - Use Docker MCPs for deployment/infrastructure

  **Level 2: Enhancement**
  - Add web scraping (Bright Data/Apify) for research
  - Use Puppeteer for testing

  **Level 3: AI Augmentation**
  - Context7 for enhanced memory
  - Knowledge Graph for complex relationships
  - Task Master for workflow management

  ## Advanced Multi-Project Workflows

  ### **Enterprise Development Workflow**

  **Step 1: Project Context Setup**
  ```markdown
  "Using the **Context7 MCP**, establish context for the       
  RepMax project.
  Load previous development decisions and current sprint       
  goals."
  ```

  **Step 2: Database Analysis**
  ```markdown
  "Using the **RepMax Supabase MCP**, analyze the current      
  schema and identify
  any performance bottlenecks or missing indexes."
  ```

  **Step 3: Competitive Research**
  ```markdown
  "Using the **Bright Data MCP**, research competitor
  features for [specific functionality].
  Extract their implementation approaches and user
  experience patterns."
  ```

  **Step 4: Implementation Planning**
  ```markdown
  "Using the **Task Master AI MCP**, break down the
  feature implementation into
  concrete tasks with dependencies and time estimates."        
  ```

  **Step 5: Development & Testing**
  ```markdown
  "Using the **Docker MCP**, set up the development
  environment, then use
  **Puppeteer MCP** to create automated tests for the new      
  feature."
  ```

  ### **Multi-Database Project Management**

  When working across multiple projects, be explicit about     
   which database:

  ```markdown
  // For RepMax
  "Using the **RepMax Supabase MCP**, check user
  authentication patterns"

  // For Dental Hub
  "Using the **Dental Hub Supabase MCP**, analyze patient      
  data structure"

  // For Tapstead
  "Using the **Tapstead Supabase MCP**, optimize menu item     
   queries"
  ```

  ## Specialized MCP Usage Patterns

  ### **Context7 MCP - Enhanced Memory**
  **Best for:** Maintaining long-term project context and      
  decisions

  ```markdown
  "Using the **Context7 MCP**, store this architectural        
  decision:
  [decision details] and retrieve any related previous
  decisions."
  ```

  **Use cases:**
  - Storing API design decisions
  - Maintaining coding standards across projects
  - Tracking technical debt decisions

  ### **Knowledge Graph Memory MCP**
  **Best for:** Complex relationship mapping and data
  modeling

  ```markdown
  "Using the **Knowledge Graph Memory MCP**, map the
  relationships between
  users, organizations, and permissions in our system."        
  ```

  **Use cases:**
  - Entity relationship planning
  - Complex business logic mapping
  - Cross-project dependency tracking

  ### **Task Master AI MCP**
  **Best for:** Project management and workflow automation     

  ```markdown
  "Using the **Task Master AI MCP**, create a development      
  roadmap for
  migrating from our current auth system to Supabase
  Auth."
  ```

  **Use cases:**
  - Sprint planning
  - Technical debt prioritization
  - Cross-team dependency management

  ### **Docker MCPs (Both Servers)**
  **Best for:** Development environment management

  ```markdown
  "Using the **Docker-MCP-Server**, set up a complete
  development environment
  for the RepMax project including database, Redis, and        
  API services."
  ```

  **Use cases:**
  - Environment standardization
  - CI/CD pipeline management
  - Production deployment automation

  ### **Web Scraping Comparison: Bright Data vs Apify**        

  **Bright Data MCP:**
  - Best for: Large-scale, production scraping
  - Use when: You need to bypass sophisticated anti-bot        
  measures
  - Example: Competitor analysis, market research

  **Apify MCP:**
  - Best for: Specific, targeted scraping tasks
  - Use when: You need pre-built actors for common sites       
  - Example: Social media monitoring, price tracking

  ```markdown
  // For complex, anti-bot protected sites
  "Using the **Bright Data MCP**, scrape [protected-site]      
  for pricing data"

  // For standard web scraping tasks
  "Using the **Apify MCP**, use the LinkedIn scraper actor     
   to gather
  company information"
  ```

  ### **College Football Data MCP**
  **Specialized use case:** If you're building
  sports-related features

  ```markdown
  "Using the **College Football Data MCP**, get team
  statistics to build
  a sports betting prediction model for our app."
  ```

  ## Performance Management for Large MCP Stacks

  ### **Connection Management**
  With 12 MCPs, connection overhead can be significant:        

  1. **Regular Health Checks:**
     ```bash
     /mcp  # Check all connections in Claude session
     ```

  2. **Selective Loading:**
     Consider temporarily removing unused MCPs for
  specific projects

  3. **Timeout Management:**
     ```bash
     MCP_TIMEOUT=15000 claude  # Increase timeout for
  complex operations
     ```

  ### **Prompt Optimization**
  With many MCPs available, be very specific:

  **❌ Poor:** "Check the database and test the website"       
  **✅ Good:** "Using the **RepMax Supabase MCP**, check       
  user table performance, then using **Puppeteer MCP**,        
  test the login flow at staging.repmax.com"

  ## Advanced Troubleshooting

  ### **MCP Conflict Resolution**
  With 12 MCPs, conflicts can occur:

  1. **Name Conflicts:** Be explicit about which MCP when      
  similar functionality exists
  2. **Resource Conflicts:** Don't run heavy operations on     
   multiple MCPs simultaneously
  3. **Timeout Conflicts:** Stagger complex operations
  across different MCPs

  ### **Performance Optimization**
  1. **Batch Operations:** Group related MCP calls
  together
  2. **Async Patterns:** Use MCPs in parallel when
  operations are independent
  3. **Caching:** Store results from expensive MCP
  operations

  ## Enterprise-Level Best Practices

  ### **1. MCP Governance**
  With this many MCPs, establish rules:
  - Document which MCP to use for which project
  - Establish naming conventions for similar MCPs
  - Regular audits of MCP usage and performance

  ### **2. Security Considerations**
  - Different Supabase MCPs = different security contexts      
  - Ensure each MCP only has access to its intended data       
  - Regular security audits of MCP permissions

  ### **3. Cost Management**
  - Monitor usage across all MCPs
  - Some MCPs (like Bright Data, Apify) have usage-based       
  costs
  - Optimize by using the most cost-effective MCP for each     
   task
