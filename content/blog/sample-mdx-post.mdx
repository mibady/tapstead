# Sample MDX Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in **MDX** format. MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your markdown files, giving you the power to create rich, interactive content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing you to:

- Write content in Markdown syntax
- Use React components directly in your content
- Create interactive blog posts
- Maintain a clean, readable format

## Features

### Code Blocks

```javascript
const blogPost = {
  title: "Sample MDX Post",
  author: "Tapstead Team",
  format: "MDX"
}

console.log(blogPost)
```

### Lists

Here are some benefits of using MDX for your blog:

1. **Rich Content**: Embed React components
2. **Maintainable**: Separate content from code
3. **Flexible**: Use any React component
4. **SEO Friendly**: Still generates static HTML
